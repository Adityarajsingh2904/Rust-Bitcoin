# ⚙️ Rust-Bitcoin – Bitcoin Library in Rust

Rust-Bitcoin is a lightweight, modular, and type-safe Bitcoin library written in Rust.  
It supports parsing, serialization, and cryptographic operations for Bitcoin data structures and messages.

Originally inspired by `rust-bitcoin`, this personalized fork provides a clean foundation for Bitcoin application developers who want clarity, modularity, and speed using Rust.
